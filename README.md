# Ramen.dev

Ramen.dev is a simple project that utilizes a large-language model (LLM) to provide users with information about my career, work experience, projects, skills, hobbies, and more. It offers a modern, interactive alternative to traditional portfolio browsing, allowing users to ask questions in plain language.

## Features

### Current Features

- Interactive chatbot with an evolving datasource.

### Planned Features

- In-depth logging of conversations to move away from an OpenAI Assistant to a custom-trained model.
- Full portfolio website with the chatbot as a true navigational alternative.
  - Ideally, this would operate as both a *chat* and *navigational aide*. Users would be able to either ask questions and be answered by the bot, or would request that the bot navigate to a page with their requested information.
